# DeepLearning---quick-projects
Based on different sources I wrote this scripts during my learning process of Neural Networks area

All of the projects were written in Jupyter Notebooks. 

# Requirements
  - Python (ver. 3.7 or higher)
  - Tensorflow (ver. 2.20 or higher)
  - NumPy
  - Pandas
  - Sklearn
  
# HOW TO RUN
Depending on the runtime environment:
- Google Colab - Just paste scripts to your google drive, open in Google Colaboratory and run scripts
- Others - Install all requirements (pip commands), export .py file from Google Colaboratory notebooks, place them in correct folder, run scripts with python3 filename.py
